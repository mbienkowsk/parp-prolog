As you slowly open your eyes, a throbbing ache reverberates through your head,
and the acrid scent of chemicals fills the air. Disoriented, you find yourself lying
on a cold metal floor in what appears to be a dimly lit locker room. The flickering
light above casts unsettling shadows on the lockers that surround you.

A soft hum of emergency alarms pulsates through the room, and the distant echoes
of chaotic commotion resonate in the air. Struggling to your feet, you notice a faint
glow emanating from a small screen hanged on the wall near the entrance.
The screen flickers to life, displaying a message in stark white letters:

"Dr S., the experiment has failed. Containment breach detected. Evacuation
protocol initiated. Escape the facility before critical systems fail. Beware of
anomalies. Your survival is paramount. Time is of the essence."

With a sense of urgency, you realize that your fate is entwined with the impending
collapse of the lab. The clock is ticking, and the path to freedom is uncertain.
true.

?- open(locker).
Ok, it is open.
true.

?- e(coat).
The lab coat stirs a sense of familiarity.
The nametag reads: "Dr. J. Sysy.", it triggers a cascade of hazy memories. As you run your
fingers over the fabric, flashes of experiments and research echo in your mind.
Memories start coming back to you, it is your coat!

?- w.
You are in the experiment room. The floor is covered in a sticky, toxic sludge.
On the other side of the room, you see a small metal tool chest. If you were only able to go through the sludge, 
you could see what's inside. The door was blown open by the failure of the experiment, it seems. The broken_door is laying next to where you stand.


true.

?- e(broken_door).
